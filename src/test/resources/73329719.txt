		<description>Supervisor Katy Tang wants to make pumping at work easier for breastfeeding moms in San Francisco. Tang introduced legislation last month that would expand current law by requiring employers to provide a lactation space that is private, not a bathroom, has access to electricity and contains a flat surface and a chair. Current law requires employers make reasonable efforts to provide breaks and a location for pumping, but doesn’t contain such specific requirements. Studies have found links between early breastfeeding and health.</description>

		<description>Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye famously wrote that "smart power is neither hard nor soft. It is both." We talk to Nye about how the U.S. can most effectively wield its power in the world's changing political landscape. We'll also hear his views on the Trump administration's decision to intervene militarily in Syria, the North Korean nuclear threat and what could be ahead for U.S.-Russia relations.</description>

		<description>The two San Francisco police officers involved in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Amilcar Perez Lopez in the Mission District in 2015 will not face criminal charges. District Attorney George Gascon announced his decision Wednesday, citing insufficient evidence and statements from officers that Lopez may have attacked another man and lunged toward the police officers with a knife before he was shot. Critics have called the shooting an example of excessive force, pointing to evidence that Lopez was shot in the back. The controversy contributed to the resignation of former Police Chief Greg Suhr, who remains listed as a defendant in a civil case tied to the shooting.</description>

		<description>Imagine that you’re driving South on 101 when you see blue and red highway patrol lights flashing behind you. Do you feel worried? How about anxious, horrified or scared? According to psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett, emotions are not something that happen to people, but rather, emotions are constructed in our brains, often with much more nuance than we readily acknowledge. Feldman Barrett joins us to talk about how emotions are made, the link between language and feelings and why assigning emotion to facial expressions has negative effects on everything from childcare to the justice system.</description>

		<description>On Sunday a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat by police after refusing to give up his spot on an overbooked flight. The video of him being dragged by his arms down the aisle went viral and sparked a public relations nightmare for United. The airline's CEO Oscar Munoz apologized on Tuesday, promising a review of the company's practices. But that was after an initial statement that called the customer "disruptive and belligerent" and saying United employees"followed established procedures." We'll take a look at the practice of overbooking flights and how removing the Asian-American passenger might affect the airline's business in China, where state media described the passenger as being of Chinese descent.</description>

The airline&#8217;s CEO Oscar Munoz apologized on Tuesday, promising a review of the company&#8217;s practices. But that was after an emotionless public statement on Monday and a leaked company email that called the customer &#8220;disruptive and belligerent&#8221; and said that United employees &#8220;followed established procedures.&#8221; We&#8217;ll take a look at the practice of overbooking flights and how removing the Asian-American passenger might affect the airline&#8217;s business in China, where state media described the passenger as being of Chinese descent.</p>

		<itunes:summary>On Sunday a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat by police after refusing to give up his spot on an overbooked flight. The video of him being dragged by his arms down the aisle went viral and sparked a public relations nightmare for United. The airline's CEO Oscar Munoz apologized on Tuesday, promising a review of the company's practices. But that was after an initial statement that called the customer "disruptive and belligerent" and saying United employees"followed established procedures."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have been around for over 100 years and despite being especially popular in the Bay Area, they&#8217;ve never quite cracked the national market. But with Tesla briefly overtaking General Motors as the most valuable automaker in America on Monday and Tesla&#8217;s more affordable Model 3 set to be released later this year, electric vehicles might be headed for the mainstream. In this hour of Forum, we&#8217;ll discuss the current state of electric cars in the U.S. and how President Trump&#8217;s policies on energy and trade might affect the EV industry.

		<description>San Francisco Supervisors on Tuesday voted 8-3 to pass a resolution pledging support of a state bill that would allow San Francisco to place a local income tax measure on the 2018 ballot. With federal budget cuts looming, supporters say the measure would raise revenue and could help address the city's wealth gap. But critics have raised concerns that the measure could inhibit economic growth and that the city should improve accountability on current spending before raising taxes. We'll discuss the bill, which proponents say would have allowed San Francisco to generate over $270 million in the 2013 tax year.</description>

		<description>The California state senate passed the California Values Act in a 27 to 21 vote along party lines on Monday. The controversial "sanctuary state" bill would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from reporting, arresting or detaining individuals for purposes of immigration enforcement. The bill would not apply to cases involving violent crimes like murder and rape. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon called the vote a "rejection of President Trump's false and cynical portrayal of undocumented residents as a lawless community." But opponents to the bill say it would shelter dangerous criminals and trigger the loss of federal funds for California. We discuss the legislation and its potential impact.</description>

		<description>Political power in the United States no longer lies with the two major political parties, but rather with "a tiny group of rich mega-donors." That's according to Jane Mayer who profiles Robert Mercer, the billionaire who helped Donald Trump win the presidency. Mayer's reporting in The New Yorker reveals how Mercer and his daughter Rebekah strategically invested large amounts of money in Breitbart News and helped position Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as President Trump's key advisers. Mayer joins us to talk about the impact of the Mercers' funding and other cases of "dark money," including a $10 million campaign supporting Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination. Her latest book now in paperback is "Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right."</description>

		<description>Long before Billy Beane’s numbers-based “Moneyball” system of choosing baseball players, and way before people expected the SF Giants to make the World Series every other year, the wild antics of an early-70s Oakland A’s team captivated the Bay Area. The A’s moved from Kansas City to Oakland in 1968, and proceeded to introduce new uniforms, grow mustaches and fight in the locker room, on the field and with the occasional journalist. They also won the World Series three times in a row -- in 1972, '73 and '74. Veteran sports reporter Jason Turbow recounts the winning - and losing - streaks of the A’s first decade in Oakland in his new book “Dynamic, Bombastic, Fantastic: Reggie, Rollie, Catfish, and Charlie Finley’s Swingin’ A’s."</description>

		<description>On Tuesday, the House approved a measure that rolls back FCC internet privacy regulations issued under the Obama administration. Under those rules, which never went into effect, the FCC would prohibit internet service providers (ISPs) from selling and sharing consumers' data. But the new bill -- which has already passed the senate and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump -- opens the door for ISPs to sell their customers'data. Telecommunication companies are celebrating the legislation, arguing that the Obama regulations were unnecessary and hurt economic growth and innovation. But consumer rights advocates see it as an attack on consumers' online privacy. In this hour, Forum hears from both sides and discusses ways that you can protect your privacy online.</description>
