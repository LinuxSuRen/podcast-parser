  <title><![CDATA[No Apologies ep  288 The Worst episode ever]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[With Juan Castro in Spain and Darrell Taylor passed out after watching The Inhumans . Last nights recording of No Apologies was left to the Hateful 3 of Gil Colon , Christopher Keszycki & Rafael Sanz . Titled The Worst episode ever in the 288 episode history of the show . We start with our Rest In Peace to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner . Then we swerved to 90s Image comics like Jerry Ordway Wildstar that's always followed by Gil going fuck him , Jae Lee 1 issue of Hellshock , Keith Giffen Trench and Larry Stroman Tribe , Pitt . This led to talk of how out of place Jack Kirby art look at Image and his Topps comics line . CK reviews Will and Grace revival which led to us asking what old shows would we bring back . We talked about FOX The Gifted Trailer & Gil admits he will watch The Inhumans . Then we lead into 90s Marvel characters Dan Ketch Ghost Rider , Darkhawk , Sleep Walker , Todd Mcfarlane & Frank Miller Talk. 
Thunder cats , Mumra , Robotech , G.I.Joe do they hold up. We go a little off the rails as we do a Hour of Nothings On the series finale of the 90s Melrose Place spinoff Models Inc , Friends , A Different World , Lisa Bonet vs Jasmine Guy , the Doobie Brothers episode of What's Happening that leads into CK , Gil and Raf awful Michael McDonald impersonations . We go into soft core porn 90s Playboy TV shows Night Calls , Electric Blue , Shannon Tweed , Red Shoes Diaries . How porn on your phone has ruin Cinemax Late night . Talk of Kira Noir and does thick Rihanna breast make coconut water . The Sheldon Chronicles , James Cameron Wonder Woman talk , Kaley Couco , The Runaways on Hulu , Homeboys in outer space , taking a knee .
We get to comics Marvel Legacy , Kamandi Challenge , Batman Metal , more Kite Man in Batman , Scott Snyder All star Batman , Wonder Woman , Action Comics getting ready for the Doomsday clock , Jim Balent Cat Woman in the 90s and Some 90s Lobo talk , Tim Drake in Detective Comics , Batman and The Shadow cross over , Blue Beetle , Steve Stroce and Lazarus by Rucka and Lark .
We talk Pam Anderson show V.I.P and her bad sidekick Natalie Raitano , Son of a Beach , the Family Matters Entertainment weekly reunion pictures .
Gil and Raf rant on NYC Homeless , the train preachers and it's showtime Dancers .
We go over how many podcast Darrell host in a week we look at Luke FosterMagnum cast and threaten a Jake and the Fatman cast .
By the end even we are bored talking for 2 hours so we start singing George Michaels , WHAM , Culture Club , The Bangles Manic Monday , Cruel summer and Venus by Bananarama .
We shout out Ken Junior and thank him for caring enough to listen and comment .
At the end Gil , Ck and Raf come to the conclusion this is the worst episode ever and we are just trying to get to the annual Gil Colon Loft Party for sugar cookies drinks and pizza with the 11 clock crew David Price ,Jason Wood , Vince B Daniel White and Chris Kipiniak after we hang at NYCC . If you can make it through over 2 hours of our rambling there some good stuff in there we also shout out Hassan Thalji and congrats to his daughter graduation .

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 199 Dan Panosian]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Dan Panosian is just a cool guy. He is an artist who has paid his dues for years, working his way up through Image Comics inking people like Rob Liefeld, doing covers for books like "Daredevil" and X-Men titles, pencilling books like "Spelljammer" at DC. He has worked in almost every aspect of comics and is finally ready to bring it all together for himself with the new creator owned book "Slots" from Skybound. A tale of a down on his luck boxer returning to his family and his roots, it draws on classic Las Vegas tropes and new traditions in the glitzy city, delving into the seedy underbelly of MMA and burlesque. Panosian, no stranger to tough guy competitions, is a man who brings his genuine love of fighting to a human story. So join us for talk about Frank Grillo, the evolution of Jumbo's Clown Room, John Steinbeck and a hilarious stripper pole story.

  <title><![CDATA[Gotham by Geeks ep 65 Kingdom Come]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Welcome to Gotham by Geeks a podcast celebrating the world of Batman. 
On this episode we have special guest Rob Krygier of Geek Brunch Retro sitting in to join in another installment of our book club episodes. 

Set in the not so distant future, the DC Universe is spinning inexorably out of control. The new generation of heroes has lost their moral compass, becoming just as reckless and violent as the villains they fight. The previous regime of heroes—the Justice League—returns under the most dire of circumstances, setting up a battle of the old guard against these uncompromising protectors in a battle that will define what heroism truly is.

Kingdom Come by Alex Ross and Mark Waid 
We want to hear from you on suggestions for future stories to read or feedback for past episodes  so send  us your emails  to gothambygeeks@gmail.com and we’ll read it on the show.

You can also Follow us on Twitter at @ByGotham or check out our Facebook page.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 196- DC/Looney Tunes]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Wendi is joined by returning friends, Dan Pua and Andrew Shaw! Together they discuss the recent crossover event b/t DC Comics characters and Looney Tunes, in particular Tom King and Lee Weeks "Batman/Elmer Fudd", Jimmy Palmiotti and Mark Texeira "Jonah Hex/Yosemite Sam" and Bill Morrison and Kelley Jones "Lobo/Roadrunner" specials. Do these succeed in entertaining on all levels or should they sink like Wile E. Coyote off of a cliff?

Also some MMA chat as Andrew Shaw tells us about his recent Brazilian Jiu Jitsu belt testing, and the gang tries to convince everyone why they should watch the now defunct Frank Grillo drama, "Kingdom". 

Brought to you by www.DCBService.com, the Discount Comic Book Service, where you can order these DC/Looney Tunes crossovers and so much more for 50% off!

As well as www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com, just because the eclipse has passed, their line of eclipse related fragrances has not!

  <description><![CDATA[Since 2011, King Bone Press, the brainchild of Jon Westhoff and Bobgar Ornelas, have been putting out independent, thoughtful work from a variety of creators- the down to earth B-One, the ridiculous monster fighting of Hillbillies, World's Strongest Mailman, Bulletproof Chicken and more. They briefly disappeared off the comic book map, but now, with the help of Jason Ford, one half of The Wombmates and writer of "The Servant", they are BACK! Jon and Jason join Wendi for a hilarious chat spanning years of friendship and some mistaken identity. They've put the band back together and are releasing new books and all their back catalog digitally and they're here to talk about it!

  <title><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 60: Let’s talk about the Island #15 ]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[So when the last issue of the anthology comic Island was released and people saw the cover by the artist Dilraj Mann of a black woman rendered all in absolute black with red lipstick and door knocker earrings hit the internet it caused quite a stir. At the time Ronald Wimberly and I thought it would be worth a conversation. So I gathered some voices from the online debate and some others we knew to have a conversation about his cover, art, editorial practices in comics and voices of black women within the comic industry.

  <description><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 59: A Conversation with cartoonist Jamar Nicholas

This episode I’m talking with the great cartoonist, teacher and Philly native Jamar Nicholas. This was a fun episode where we cover all types of topics - old video games, table top gaming, going to arcades in the hood back in the 90s, black folks and being a cartoonist as a whole. 

Plus some thoughts on King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Alien: Covenant.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 194  Rich Tommaso/Antony Johnston]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Wendi examines the creators of two very different spy books from Image Comics. Both writers tell stories of the cold war influenced by their impressions growing up. 

First, she talks to Rich Tommaso, writer and artist of "Spy Seal". In "The Corten Steel Phoenix" he tells the story of a seal forced into dangerous circumstances beyond his control. He uses anthropomorphic animals to weave a web of politics and intrigue. 

After the break, she has a chat with Antony Johnston on the day the film, "Atomic Blonde" is released. Based on his graphic novel "The Coldest City", Charlize Theron portrays MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton in her very cool, calculated style. He discusses his involvement in the filmmaking process and how much it detracts from and stays true to the source material. He has a new series out now, "Ghost Station Zero"- vol. 2 of his series "Codename: Baboushka", an action packed, pulp thriller with a sexy Russian female lead.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 185 JK Woodward/Mark Russell and Steve]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[This episode kicks off with a Free Comic Book Day preview from artist JK Woodward of his new book "Star Trek:The Next Generation- Broken Mirror", which depicts a "Mirror, Mirror" universe representation of the Next Generation cast. Written by frequent collaborators Scott and David Tipton, the first issue is available free on May 6 at your local comic shop.

Then Wendi is joined by the creative team behind the much heralded DC comic "The Flintstones". Part of the recent Hanna Barbera line, this reimagining of Bedrock's famous family depicts the changing society of the paleolithic era- from the angst of the armadillo bowling ball to Fred and Barney's time in the war. It captures existential dilemmas in a surprising fashion for a cartoon comic. Writer Mark Russell and artist Steve Pugh discuss their new interpretation and style and how they got away with something so daring, as well as what Russell has in mind for his new Snaggletooth comic.

Brought to you by www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com presenting a new line of fragrances and body products based on the Neil Gaiman novel, “American Gods”.

As well as www.dcbservice.com where you can find deep discounts and reliable service on all your favorite comics every day.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 180- Greg Schigiel]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Gregg Schigiel is an artist who is part of the vanguard of new all ages characters in comics. Currently working on "Spongebob Squarepants", he is the creator of "Pix", a book about a teen fairy princess with superpowers trying to navigate high school. He tells us how the book fits in at Image, why he prefers to call them "kids books" over "all ages", the greatness of the NBC show "Ed", his legendary 90s Marvel Spider-Man comic "Fastlane", and working for Marvel during bankruptcy. He's also an avid podcaster with two shows- "Stuff Said" and "Cruisin Together", which leads to extensive Tom Cruise discussion as well as his unrelated hilarious analysis of "Rosemary's Baby". A lively and amusing episode to be sure!

  <description><![CDATA[Hey folks this episode basically just a friendly conversation about Art with my friends frequent guest Ronald Wimberly (Prince of Cats, Black History in it’s Own Words, Lighten Up) and Aerosyn Lex Mestrovic (worked with LVMH, CFDA, Public School, Nike & more). We cover subjects about the Instagram’s effect on Fine Art and the nature of branding in Fine Art. Some thoughts on this past year’s Art Basel in Miami, Florida and ComplexCon in Long Beach, Ca. Thoughts on reaching audience and who your market is and overall thoughts on personal views on working in the creative fields. I hope you enjoy.

The Boroding family has been made the ruling house over its’ culture and its’ patriarch crowned as Good King Peridyym the First, sending explorers out to colonize and expand the growing population of former sailors yearning to till soil once again, shepherd livestock… stand once again on firm unyielding ground and hand down to their children the security of a world that could no longer capsize them by the dozens on any mercurial swell of the tide, nor devour them by the hundreds on the capricious hunger of the unseen, rising leviathan.

You are invited now to listen to the adventures of one such band of explorers, charged by Good King Peridyym and guided by the divine province of his chief adviser, The Lord Prefect Archlon Balmoral, into the settlements and strongholds of expansion, into the unknown challenges and mysteries of the land laid out before them … into more than just survival … this … is the World of Peridyym!



Everyone has a noble or adventurous motive for joining the Mission Guild… and then there’s Hex, Mervis and Sellick!

Listener Questions & Comments:
 
Tom wells
I hope it's not a question in bad taste, but I wanna know how you would address Carrie Fisher's death in Episode 9.
Would you recast her? Give Leia an off-screen death? Maybe just somehow write her out of the script? Maybe even use CGI?
I personally think they should put a death scene near the start of the movie, maybe with her ship being destroyed, with most shots of her being from behind, as well as using old footage, CGI, etc to create somewhat of a story arc with the First Order killing the leader of the Resistance.
What do you guys think?

Darrell Taylor
What do you think the connection will be if any with the Guardians of the Whills and the Knights of Ren?

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread  ep 172- Christmas Classics]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Wendi is rejoined by very dear friends, Bill Zanowitz of the "Comic Book Bears" podcast and writer of "The Crimefighter Inquiry", and writer/folk artist Jeff "Bean" Douglas. They have a full and lengthy discussion of the best Christmas comics from Batman, Starman, DC digests, X-Men, Lobo and Disney to name a few. Things take a hilarious turn in their discussion of best holiday songs as Bill explains the history of "Nestor the Long Eared Christmas Donkey" and a favorite album of a drag queen and some mentally challenged children. 

So pull up a glass of eggnog, break open the longbox and celebrate the season as we tell stories of which comic characters are Jewish, tragic deaths of artists who worked too hard and why "Diner" is the best holiday movie.

  <description><![CDATA[Darrell and J.K. respond to the announcement of Sonequa Martin-Green being cast as the lead of Star Trek: Discovery. As always we talk about our opinions on the news, review her past roles, speculate about the upcoming show, and discuss the choice as it relates to past Trek precedent. 

Discussions include Star Trek VI:The Undiscovered Country, the relationship between captains and first officers in past Trek Shows, the veteran starring role actress/first-time starring role actress dynamic, imagining what a "2 ship show" might look like, Chekote in the 7 year "friend zone", and Captain Picard's muscle-y arms.

  <description><![CDATA[No, your downloads aren't wonky. The guys did release two episodes within two weeks of each other. The two of them are rounding the bend on season three, covering "Legacy From a Friend" and "Two Birds of a Feather." The latter is what makes Luke so annoyed, and the only way to find out why is to listen. So strap in and come along for the ride!

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 170- Standing Rock Experiences]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Please excuse the boomy audio of this episode, it was recorded live from the International School of Comics in Chicago. This is a very special dialogue with artists Jill Thompson (Scary Godmother, Wonder Woman: The True Amazon, Sandman), Jim Terry (The Crow: Skinning the Wolves, Alice Cooper vs. CHAOS), and Maria Wolf Lopez. Separately, the three of them have gone to the Standing Rock camp in ND where Native American Water Protectors are trying to prevent construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which will pollute important water aquifers all across the midwest. They explain the situation from an eye witness perspective, discuss what supplies are desperately needed at the camps, extol on the spirituality and generosity the people and Maria tells us of her experiences at the first Indigenous Comic Convention.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 168 Onrie Kompan]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Onrie Kompan has defied the rules of the comic industry to be very successful on his own terms. Without the help of a publisher or mainstream comic distribution he is a one man army. Currently he has a documentary being made about his remarkable achievement of selling over 1500 comics at NYCC. Not bad for an American writing a historical comic about a Korean sea battle. His work is featured in Korean museums, he has been invited to do many speaking engagements and has been a consultant on a movie about the life of Yi Soon Shin. This is an uplifting episode about the power of believing in comics and the lessons of how to be a good neighbor at conventions and raise everyone up with you.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 167 Brian Pulido]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Artist/Writer Brian Pulido is a longstanding pioneer of independent horror comics. Known for creating such characters as Evil Ernie, Purgatori and Lady Death, he has always had an uncompromising vision and rock and roll sensibility. Recently his Lady Death Kickstarters have been setting records and breaking the comic distribution model. He shares the story of losing his Chaos Comics characters to lawsuits and how he overcame that adversity to achieve his current success. Pulido is still a groundbreaker in variant covers, using materials like Swarovski crystals and leather, we predict the Gwar comic a week before it was announced, and discuss his love of punk and metal with an analysis of what makes a good "Cookie Monster singer".

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 161 Cory Levine/Sanya Anwar]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA["Bowery Boys" is a webcomic from writer Cory Levine and artists Ian Bertram and Brent McKee, recently released in print by Dark Horse Comics. Levine discusses the intricacies of his historical slice of New York, from the gangster slang to the brutality of kid gangs, the organization of unions and the evolving ethnic landscapes.

The second half of the episode is a conversation with Sanya Anwar, artist of the exceptional webcomic "1001", the tale of "1001 Arabian Nights" from Scheherazade's perspective. Her gorgeous, flowing style can also be seen on variant covers from "Assassin's Creed" to "Jughead". She talks about nerding out on art supplies, growing up Pakistani in Canada, and working her first SDCC.

Please forgive the   background audio noise at the beginning that lasts less than 10min.]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 45: David Brothers x Ron Wimberly SDCC Spotli]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[I was at San Diego comic con and there while getting to meet people I haven’t known before I got to see old friends. A good thing while there is that I got get a couple of panels recorded. The first one of these is the Spotlight on Ronald Wimberly panel moderated by David Brothers. Both are the homies and been guests on this show. Check out the programing information below.

“For the past 14 years, Ronald Wimberly has been telling stories that pair his world view with his strong storytelling instincts, resulting in works like the Eisner Award-nominated Lighten Up and The Prince of Cats, his collaborations with brands like Nike and Mishka, and even designing for animation like Black Dynamite. Wimberly will share his perspective on designing stories, agitprop and the politics of aesthetics, culture and appropriation, the importance of iconoclasm and why he suspects he'll never work for Marvel or DC again. Moderated by David Brothers.”

  <title><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 44: Ronald Wimberly 5  ]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[So a few weeks back Ron posted a piece of writing on Tumblr called “Stop doing spec pages: Why DC, Marvel, Boom etc. should pay you for your test pages.” He wrote about how the Majors of the comic book industry shouldn’t solicit free spec pages from artists they might want on their comics. We talk that and some of the discussion it caused in some places online. We go into more comic business ethics talk and identity within the culture of comics. There are some tangents on film and television.

There are some tangents on film and television.

He is also currently publishing his online illustrated young adult novel "Asha Ascending", with artist Sara Richard, which is open to input and changes with audience feedback. Hear all that as well as Tony award and Hamilton discussions, current music related tv shows, the Musicians on Call non-profit, Valiant comics and so much more!

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 151 Shawn Pryor]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In one of her very favorite conversations, Wendi is joined by writer, publisher, podcaster, talent scout and master raconteur, Shawn Pryor. He talks about the hard work of the comic hustle, how to avoid burnout, the difference between diversity and equality and his time at Action Lab Comics and his new imprint Crowntaker Studios, his current all ages mystery story "Cash and Carrie", the upcoming "Motherless Creatures" with Tressina Bowling, as well as "F.O.R.C.E.", a football story not just for sports fans.

Plus hilarious pop diva speculations and storytelling about Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey, the lost Fox hip hop cop shows "New York Undercover" and "Fastlane", what is Jon B up to? and so much more!

  <description><![CDATA[BACK! BY (what should have been) POPULAR DEMAND! The ARTS AND CRAP crew make Darrell "Anti-Life" Taylor take another bite at the maple-flavored apple that is the oeuvre of Canadian avant-garde auteur , Guy  "One of the greatest film directors in history" Maddin!  Long-time listeners know we covered Maddin's feature debut, TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL, in episode 5 and Darrell was . . . not happy.  After viewing this 2007 masterpiece, which starred Ann Savage (What a woman!, Two-man Submarine, Saved by the Bell), and Lewis Negin (Sissy-Boy Slap-Party, The Forbidden Room), did Darrell revise his opinion of the celebrated cinematic innovator? Or is he still a friggin' idiot?*

Also, what did Sheila "Friend of the Working Man" Villari think? And why does Chris "Kindness, love, butterflies, rainbows, peace, and stuff" Kipiniak put up with either of them? Listen . . . and find out!

  <media:title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 24 My Winnipeg]]></media:title>
  <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[BACK! BY (what should have been) POPULAR DEMAND! The ARTS AND CRAP crew make Darrell "Anti-Life" Taylor take another bite at the maple-flavored apple that is the oeuvre of Canadian avant-garde auteur , Guy  "One of the greatest film directors in history" Maddin!  Long-time listeners know we covered Maddin's feature debut, TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL, in episode 5 and Darrell was . . . not happy.  After viewing this 2007 masterpiece, which starred Ann Savage (What a woman!, Two-man Submarine, Saved by the Bell), and Lewis Negin (Sissy-Boy Slap-Party, The Forbidden Room), did Darrell revise his opinion of the celebrated cinematic innovator? Or is he still a friggin' idiot?*

Also, what did Sheila "Friend of the Working Man" Villari think? And why does Chris "Kindness, love, butterflies, rainbows, peace, and stuff" Kipiniak put up with either of them? Listen . . . and find out!

  <title><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 36: 2015 in Film with Dominic Griffin]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Episode 36 starts a three episode stint on 2015 in Film. The first conversation is with my friend Dominic Griffin.

We discuss Godzilla and Gamera, balancing cute art with prison rape, tropes of "women in prison" films, his career doing layouts for books like Alan Moore's "Top Ten", and the religious preferences of mecha kaiju!]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 21 Brooklyn]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[BROOKLYN is not a movie about overpriced artisanal pickles or self-satisfied smirks curling underneath twee facial hair configurations. Instead, it’s a study of self-determination as shown through the story of a young woman coming to America from Ireland in the 1950s.  (spoiler alert: it’s a wonderful film!)



It stars Saoirse Ronan (The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, Muppets Most Wanted) and Domhnall Gleeson (Anything in 2014 or 2015 . . . Name it, he’s in it . . . ) and has a screenplay by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity – the novel, not the screenplay, though the screenplay was based on his novel).

  <title><![CDATA[Ignorant Bliss 34: A chat with Warren Bernard]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[So I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to Warren Bernard, executive director of Small Press Expo and author of the book Cartoons for Victory. I met him at this past year’s SPX and was kind enough to invite me over to his house to see his extensive collections of comics, cartoons, and books library then to talk to me for this here show. This might be the closest to an interview I’ve done so I hope you enjoy it. Check out the blog post to see some a pic of stuff from the visit and please check out SPX if you haven’t and a link to the book. P.S. here are some pictures of the Hambone’s Meditations that was talked about in the episode. Please note this is hella racist but it is history.
 

Also I’ve restarted my Teespring campaign with Ignorant Bliss apparel to help me but some new recording equipment. You can get it here, and also I’ve opened up an email for the show you can email the show at ignorantblisspodcast [at] gmail [dot] com.

Here’s links about Warren’s book and to purchase it:

  <itunes:summary><![CDATA[So I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to Warren Bernard, executive director of Small Press Expo and author of the book Cartoons for Victory. I met him at this past year’s SPX and was kind enough to invite me over to his house to see his extensive collections of comics, cartoons, and books library then to talk to me for this here show. This might be the closest to an interview I’ve done so I hope you enjoy it. Check out the blog post to see some a pic of stuff from the visit and please check out SPX if you haven’t and a link to the book. P.S. here are some pictures of the Hambone’s Meditations that was talked about in the episode. Please note this is hella racist but it is history.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 136- Behemoth and PI Jane]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Wendi talks to two creative teams of popular webcomics- first half with artist JK Woodward (Star Trek, Doctor Who, Fallen Angel) and writer Chris Kipiniak about their book, Behemoth, now available in a 4 story arc from Monkeybrain Comics. Best described as "Island of Dr. Moreau meets the Dirty Dozen" it details the story of a girl's descent into monsterhood and joining an elite mercenary team of teens in varying degrees of transformation. All of it is available now digitally, only 99 cents each, through Comixology.

After that, it's time for the team behind the long running book, PI Jane- cowriters Lauren Burke (Womanthology) and Greg Sorkin and artist Tony Maldonado. They bring their comedic sensibilities to discussing the funny, irreverent, pop culture style of the girl detective, as well as the popular side story of "Cake Vs. Pie" and Tony's skill at drawing violent food. Soon to have new issues released through Caliber, you can find the story until now at Monkeys Plus Typewriters.]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[MagnumCast episode 20 Luke and the Colonel rip on each other]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[There must have been something in the water, because Luke and the Colonel spent even more time making fun of each other than usual. They also came up with a dynamite, award-winning idea for a Magnum, PI reboot/sequel that Hollywood should totally hire them to write. They also, in spite of themselves, managed to wrap up their look at season two with reviews of The Elmo Ziller Story and Three Minus Two. So enjoy your holidays with the guys' ridiculous ramblings and we'll see you all in 2016!​

  <title><![CDATA[Comic Racks Snarkcast ep 18 White Lines and Purple Passion]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In this uncharacteristically emotional episode, Gerri and Darrell get all emo about chemo as they take on Marvel’s The Mighty Thor written by Jason Aaron with art by Russell Dauterman. The pathos is real as they discuss the Marvel Max classic, Alias from Brian Micheal Bendis and Michael Gaydos and then move on to more lighthearted, semi-autobiographical fun by tackling the outrageously meta Image mini run, Airboy from writer/artist team James Robinson and Greg Hinkle. Don’t miss the super-spoiler ending as they cover the Netflix series Jessica Jones starring Krysten Ritter as Jessica and the uber-rapey Purpleman, played by David Tennant!

  <description><![CDATA[On a very special arts and crap, we go to the "thee-uh-tuh" (must be said in British accent)!  Chris Kipiniak (Love Life, writer of BEHEMOTH from Monkeybrain comics, co-host of Arts and Crap) is performing in the play IN THE SOUNDLESS AWE, by Jayme McGhan, Andy Pederson directed by Sarah Norris   about the worst Naval Disaster in U.S. History,  the sinking of the U.S.S Indianapolis.  Darrell came and saw. Did he love it?  Or was he content to heckle and throw pretzels at the stage? Before that we talk about some of the tv/films we have been watching like the Netflix show Master of None by Aziz Ansari and Beast of No Nation from director Cary Joji Fukunaga

  <description><![CDATA[On this very spooky episode of DPS, Wendi is joined by Kat Rocha and Josh Finney of 01 Publishing. In addition to their comics they've also released two volumes of short fiction related to H.P. Lovecraft, so who better to bring in on an episode devoted to the elder gods? They explore every aspect of Lovecraft's influence on movies, comics and games, from Stuart Gordon to Sam Raimi to Dungeons and Dragons. Does the Cthulhu mythos still have the bite it once did? How was Lovecraft connected to the other writers of his day, like Robert E. Howard?]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[JK's Happy Hour: Steve Orlando]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In this episode we have special guest  joining us at the pub  comic creator Steve Orlando. We jump into the fan favorite DC book starring everyone's favorite trench coat wearing vigilante The MIDNIGHTER. Steve shares what goes into writing a well rounded comic character that is set in the fantastic world of superheroes. Plus a little info on his upcoming issue in BATMAN and ROBIN eternal #5. Then we dig into his creator owned Image comic VIRGIL which has a nice blending of the revenge exploitation films.  VIRGIL is a heavy-hitting and heartbreaking tale of one man's battle against an oppressive and violent community. Steve expresses how he writes the lead character who is gay as a real character and not a stereotype.

  <title><![CDATA[MagnumCast Episode 18: At Least the Colonel is Good at His J]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Sometimes Luke is good at podcasting. Luke is not good at fixing lawn mowers. Today he tried to fix a lawn mower. It didn't work. He also tried coordinating with the person who DOES know how to fix the mower while simultaneously podcasting, so apologies if he sounds a little distracted. But he and the Colonel still manage to review season two episodes "One More Summer" and "Texas Lightning," and they both liked them, so that's something.

  <description><![CDATA[So here we have the 4th conversation with my friend Ron Wimberly. We talk about Ta-Nehisi Coates’ new book Between The World and Me. We also talk about how the people co-opt slang using the phrase “Basic Bitch”. We then talk about the dissemination of art and music in American society along with the comics industry. We focus on “blerd” and geek culture and if we feel we fit into it all along with just life and making work. I hope you enjoy.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep Matt Sturges/Dave Justus]]></title>

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 17 Inside Llewyn Davis]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[This week, we go inside, Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coen Brothers' take on music, art, life, and the merchant marine.  This is the movie that made a star of Oscar Isaac, playing a difficult, flinty, self-important Artiste who has more dignity than sense.  Any similarity between the main character and one of this podcast's hosts is not so much coincidental as LIBELOUS!

Starring the afore-mentioned Isaac (Julliard grad, class of 2005, Drive), and Carey Mulligan (Doctor Who, Drive).

He’s also an accomplished designer designing a lot of the modern logos for Marvel Comics hot titles. We talk about a lot of our thoughts on the business of comics and the mind state of the people within it. We then trail off on talks about Akira Toriyama and Legos.

  <description><![CDATA[Accomplished writer of animation and comics, Mairghread Scott comes on the show to discuss her latest project from Archaia, "Toil and Trouble" with artists Kelly and Nicole Matthews. "Toil and Trouble" is a Shakespearian labor of love, depicting the story of Macbeth from the perspective of the three witches. The book is fully comprehensible if you've never read the play and provides a richer interpretation if you're already a fan.

She also answers many question about her wealth of work in the Transformers universe, including writing Windblade and the recent crossover event "Combiner Wars". Animation secrets are divulged including exactly how long a character is allowed to scream for and exactly what is a "Keep alive groan"?]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread Episode 122 - Marvel and Hip Hop]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Recently Marvel comics announced a month of hip hop themed variant covers, recreating famous album covers with their titles. This brought into light an issue about the lack of African Americans hired by the company and diversity both on the page and behind the scenes. In this episode Wendi is joined by artist Julian Lytle (Ignorant Bliss podcast), Rafael Sanz (No Apologies podcast) and Darrell Taylor (Taylor network of Podcasts). For years Julian and Shawn Pryor worked on the "Longboxes on 22s" tumblr (www.longboxeson22s.tumblr.com ) that mashed up hip hop culture and comic books only to go ignored by Marvel and DC.

This discussion goes far beyond the ideas of cultural appropriation into a discourse of hiring practices, how to find new talent, what the role of an editor should be and being racially tactful. Also what rappers really do fit which superheroes!]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[Zack Kruse has been organizing the well regarded Appleseed convention in Fort Wayne, IN, as well as putting out his own stories and doing academic work in comic history for some time. He has a chat with Wendi about nurturing young creators at conventions, fairy hoaxes, if Dana Scully was a pragmatist or a dogmatist, and a lengthy discussion of his research on the reclusive Steve Ditko- who really created Spider-Man, similiarities between Peter Parker and Blue Beetle, his use of objectivism and the introspective nature of his work. It's an interesting discourse for anyone fascinated by the backstory of Marvel Comics and Stan Lee.]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 118 C2E2]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[The majority of this episode was taped at the C2E2 after event, ICE, the Indie Comics Expo, held by King Bone Press in Chicago back in May. The first live panel is a discussion of independent publishing featuring Jon Westhoff and Bobgar Ornelas of King Bone Press and the Earth 2 podcast network, as well as James and Jason Ford, of the Wombmates podcast and "The Servant" comic. They discuss the challenges of getting your comic noticed and going digital vs. print.

The second panel is with writer Ed Brisson. He has recently reissued his breakthrough title "Murder Book" as well as an excellent sc-fi prison tale "Cluster" and his unconventional superhero story "The Mantle" from Image. 

In part 3 Wendi catches up with writer James Robinson, creator of "Starman" and recent writer of Fantastic Four. They discuss the legacy of Jack Knight, the chemistry of sobriety, Battleworlds and his semi-autobiographical new series from Image, "Airboy".

  <description><![CDATA[Apologies, first of all, for some sound issues in this episode- a new headset mic was being used and it ran a bit hot and picked up too much breathing. 
Artist Dan Dougherty comes on to discuss his long running, award winning newspaper cartoon, Beardo - how syndication works, how comic strips are staying alive, and the legacy of cartooning. He is also 6 issues deep into a supernatural thriller comic called "Touching Evil", about a woman with a deadly gift she can't seem to shake. They discuss his varying art styles, working with actor Dan Fogler, the consistency of placenta and much more!]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 14 Ex Machina]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[This week we discuss Ex Machina, the robot thriller (?) that allows novelist-screenwriter-producer-videogamewriter-brit-human to add "director" to his already exhausting list of hyphenates.
The movie says something about humanity, I guess. Or maybe it says something about robots.  Either way, it stars Alicia Vikander (Min balsamerade mor, Levande föda) as the robot, Domhnall Gleeson (Frank, and an episode of Black Mirror where HE was the robot), Oscar Isaac (the guy in the new Star Wars trailer who looks really excited to be flying an X-wing), and literally 7 other people. That's it.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 114- Gene Ha and Onrie Kompan]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Gene Ha is one of the most thorough, detailed and good natured artists working in comics today. Known for his DC work such as "The Shade" and "Project: Superman" as well as Alan Moore's "Top Ten", it's time for him to step into his own creator owned fantasy. Which is exactly what he's doing with "Mae", a young adult, female driven story about friendship and sisterhood and strange creatures with Czech names. He and Wendi talk about this new project, how to run a successful kickstarter and the appeal of smart brunettes!

Check out the kickstarter for Mae right here- https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geneha/mae-graphic-novel

Onrie Kompan is an international storyteller who has earned acclaim in Korea for his comic, Yi Soon Shin, detailing the daring exploits of a brave Korean Naval Commander. His gritty historical epic is perfect for those who like bloodshed and dark adventure. He and Wendi discuss the delicate balance of vulnerability in female characters and how to craft a successful sales pitch at conventions.

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap Episode 13: Under The Skin]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[This week we have 50% more crap! Sheila Valleri joins us again to discuss Under the Skin, Jonathan Glazer (Sexy Beast – that’s a movie, not an assessment)’s 2013 film about an alien who prowls the streets of a Scottish city (Edinburgh, maybe?) shot using hidden cameras, non-professional actors, and one of the world’s biggest movie stars.  Not, however, using a lot of dialogue.   
The film stars Jeremy McWilliams (prize-winning motorcyclist, screen debut), Dougie McConnell (screen debut), Andrew Gorman (screen debut), and Scarlett Johansson (Ghost World).

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 12: Killer Of Sheep]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Charles Burnett (To Sleep with Anger, The Glass Shield)’s MFA thesis film went without a theatrical release for about 30 years due to difficulty in obtaining music licenses. But in 2007 the rights were secured and the world at large was introduced to his chronicle of urban life in the 70s, shot in a style reminiscent of the Italian neo-realists.  Sure, The National Society of Film Critics says it’s one of the 100 Essential Films, but more important, what does the Arts and Crap crew think?

The film starts Henry G. Sanders (Whiplash [so you can program yourself an Arts and Crap/Henry G. Sanders playlist], The Rockford Files), and Kaycee Moore (Bless Their Little Hearts, Daughters of the Dust).

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 11 Wetlands]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Wetlands was described as, “the most wtf, nsfw movie at this year’s sundance film festival,” by whoever was quoted on the poster. This German coming-of-age story is based on Charlotte Roche’s debut novel and focuses on a girl who has divorced parents and unconventional views on hygiene. Was it a groundbreaking exploration of the limits of intimacy, or a loose retelling of The Parent Trap with anal fissures as a plot device? 
The film stars up-and-comer Carla Juri (Stationspiraten, Der Kriminalist), and Meret Becker (Die kleine Meerjungrau) in a role unlike anything you’ve seen her in before! 
We are joined by guest co-host Sheila Valleri as we probe all the nooks, crannies and orifices of this film which co-host Darrel Taylor said made him want to, “bleach my [his] eyes.”

  <description><![CDATA[Kaare Andrews has never limited himself to one dream. Whether he's drawing Spider-Man or directing Cabin Fever: Patient Zero, Andrews is challenging himself in the best medium to tell the most complete story. Which is what makes "Iron Fist: The Living Weapon" such a definitive piece in the character's legacy. He and Wendi have an extensive talk about the real origins of the kung fu character, why you have to fight a robot after a dragon, a shared love of Scott Adkins and modern action stars and control issues between genre filmmaking and comics. ]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 10 The Affair pt 2]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[The exciting conclusion of our 2-part discussion of Showtime’s The Affair, a show which, like this podcast, is built around diverging perspectives on the same story. This week we discuss episodes 6-10, including the season finale.  More subjectivity! More adultery! More Hamptons!
It still stars all the same people, including Maura Tierney (NewsRadio, The Wooster Group’s 2010 revival of North Atlantic at the Baryshnikov Arts Center), and Joshua Jackson (Racing Stripes, The Skulls) as the wronged spouses, and Darren Goldstein (Limitless, the 2015 short film, Love Life).

  <description><![CDATA[This week, Darrell and Chris are joined by comic book auteur/mental health professional Alan White (http://thepowerprinciple.co/) to discuss Cake – Daniel Barnz’s dramedy (come-rama?) about grief, pain and fear.  It is only tangentially related to baking. 
The movie stars Jennifer Anniston (Leprechaun, Horrible Bosses 2, every American woman’s hair-style in 1996-7),  Adriana Barraza (Tres piezas de amor en un fin de semana, CSI: Miami) and Sam Worthington (Avatar, Australia [the country, not the movie]).

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 8 The Affair]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Showtime’s The Affair is a new drama about a . . . (wait for it . . .) affair, told each week from both his and her point of view. Think of it as Rashomon: the series. Many hailed the first episode as the best pilot of the new television season. Was it?
It stars Ruth Wilson (2009’s The Prisoner remake, one of the many Jane Eyres), Dominic West (John Carter, Punisher: War Zone) and also has the guy who plays Carmine Falcone in Gotham.
In the first of a special two-parter, we talk about the first 5 episodes as well as our own personal failings!

  <title><![CDATA[Arts and Crap ep 6 Whiplash]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Sundance 2014 was all about Whiplash - Damien Chazelle's directorial debut, a sort of music-conservatory-set version of To Sir With Love . . . only without the love.  It stars Miles Teller (Mr. Fantastic from the upcoming Fantastic Four film) and J.K. Simmons (J.Jonah Jameson from Raimi's Spider-Man, the loveable nazi from Oz). We discuss the film along with themes of genius, spoiled-brattedness, and Stockholm syndrome.

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 99- Sampsa Granstrom]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[It's the return of everyone's favorite Helsinki native, Sampsa Granstrom, back to talk more comics! Sampsa and Wendi discuss what they're reading and watching lately (She Hulk, Gotham Academy, Batgirl, Wicked and Divine and more), discuss the merits of limited series, and then get into some reviews.

They discuss 3 books from Steve Niles' new imprint, Black Mask Studios. "Critical Hit" (Matt Miner, Jonathan Brandon Sawyer), "Pirhouette" (Mark Miller, Carlos Granda) and "Last Born" (Patrick Meaney, Eric Zawadzki). Upon typing this, Wendi now realizes that is Mark MILLER, not MILLAR and feels kinda silly. 

They also dissect "World War Kaiju" from 01 Publishing, written by Josh Finney, art by Patrick McEvoy. 

Wendi absolutely despised one of these books and very much loved another, so listen to find out!

And please consider contributing to the fund for our late friend, Jeremy Dale, to help his family cover funeral expenses. www.gofundme.com/jeremydale]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 98- Halloween with Archie]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In the past couple of years Archie Comics has taken a number of risks, none more daring than launching adult horror comic, "Afterlife with Archie". This zombie take on good ol' Riverdale has become a tremendous success and now spawned a spinoff comic, "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", featuring the popular teen witch.

Wendi talks to "Afterlife" variant cover artist, Andrew Pepoy, about his fun, pin up style approach to Betty and Veronica getting terrorized. He shares "breaking in to the business" stories and talks about his original characters, "Simone and Ajax". His work can also be seen as an upcoming variant to "Archie meets Predator" #4. 

Next Robert Hack comes by to discuss his unique, sepia tinged style on "Sabrina". He talks about his horror influences and how much he's allowed to get away with on an Archie book. Both titles take a lot of chances and feature unique creative styles unlike anything else on the comic rack. ]]></description>

This zombie take on good ol' Riverdale has become a tremendous success and now spawned a spinoff comic, "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", featuring the popular teen witch.

Wendi talks to "Afterlife" variant cover artist, Andrew Pepoy, about his fun, pin up style approach to Betty and Veronica getting terrorized. He shares "breaking in to the business" stories and talks about his original characters, "Simone and Ajax". His work can also be seen as an upcoming variant to "Archie meets Predator" #4. 

Next Robert Hack comes by to discuss his unique, sepia tinged style on "Sabrina". He talks about his horror influences and how much he's allowed to get away with on an Archie book. Both titles take a lot of chances and feature unique creative styles unlike anything else on the comic rack. ]]></media:text>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 97- Linnea Quigley and Jim Wynorski]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[​Linnea Quigley has made a name for herself in over 150 movies as America's scream queen. She's been bad girls, zombies, victims and predators in films such as "Return of the Living Dead" and "Night of the Demons". Wendi gets to talk briefly to her horror girlcrush and learns about the sisterhood of scream queens. Recently Linnea had some tremendous damage to her roof and needs some help through crowdsourcing. Go check out her cause at http://www.gofundme.com/8tvf3o.

Director Jim Wynorski first broke with the 80s terrorizing robots in "Chopping Mall". Since then he's made over 12 creature features on SyFy ("Camel Spiders", Dinocroc vs. Supergator") and many Cinemax soft core porn parody films like "The Bare Wench Project", "CleavageField", "The Hills have Thighs". He enlightens Wendi on shooting films quickly and under budget, giving Traci Lords her first non-porn role, and the joys of women in prison movies. The man who gave us "Vampirella" and "Return of Swamp Thing" also gives the best answer about what comic book movie he'd really like to make.]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 94 Peter Bagge]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[Peter Bagge has one of the most legendary styles in indie comics history. His Buddy Bradley and "Hate" comics were a pivotal part of 90s Seattle underground culture and his work still shows up in a diverse array of places, from DC and Marvel to Mad magazine and political journals. He discusses overcoming the "slacker" and grunge stigma, engages in an extensive discussion of Zora Neale Hurston and race relations in light of Ferguson, and where he gets treated better- indie art shows or Wizard World. It's a funny conversation with many enlightening moments. ]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Double Page Spread ep 89 Josh Fialkov/Gabo and Tidewater Con]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[​In this episode Wendi goes to Aw Yeah! Comics to celebrate the release of Oni Press' "The Life After" with writer Joshua Hale Fialkov and artist Gabo! They discuss the new book and it's concepts of spirituality and purgatory as well as his previous work on "The Bunker" and "I, Vampire". Then he makes suicide sound very appealing.

Next is a conversation with Mike Federali, organizer of Tidewater Con, an upstart comic convention in Virginia Beach. He's an energetic, enthusiastic proponent of really making comics part of the community for everyone. He's assembled this convention with guests like Sam Huntington, Joel Hodgson, Pop Mahn, Nancy Collins and more. In the wake of SDCC it's interesting to hear someone from the other end of organizing discuss cosplay issues, the evolution of artists alley and what the real logistics are.]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[Just in time for Marvel to announce a black Captain America! It's DPS Live from Third Coast Comics in Chicago!

Wendi is joined by documentary filmmaker Tony G. Williams (Carbonerdious: the Rise of Black Nerd Culture), retailer Terry Gant and podcast mogul Darrell Taylor. It's a hilarious and raucous time as Wendi lets loose on the ignorant #firerickremender blogger and the group tackles race relations such as Reginald Hudlin and the Black Panther/Storm relationship, why black characters generally have lightning/electrical powers, rappers dressed like Spawn and the legacy of Dwayne MacDuffie and Milestone. ]]></description>

  <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[Josh Emmons is a longtime partner of Four Star Studios, Chicago's greatest comics collective, with Tim Seeley, Mike Norton, Sean Dove and Jenny Frison. Wendi tries to get him to dish on some of their highly anticipated projects, like the new Batman title "Grayson", and "Sundowners" from Image. 

It's a loose, fun conversation between friends on topics from the Muppet musicians, how Charles Xavier makes his money, the David Finch Wonder Woman controversy, and extensive Jim Steranko stories. 

So join in on the conversation and feel free to send feedback! You can always record an mp3 and send it to doublepagespread@gmail.com or Wendi will read your letters on the air.]]></media:text>

  <description><![CDATA[Tim Hanley recently wrote a book on the history of Wonder Woman- "Wonder Woman Unbound- the Curious History of the World's Most Famous Heroine" that breaks down the fascinating story behind her legendary creator. He discusses that as well as all of her eras from Themyscyra to karate chopping, from her George Perez period to the best known Greg Rucka stories. We delve into her full feminist and fetishist past!

Next Wendi talks to artist Vanesa Del Rey, whose inky noir style can be seen in crime thriller "Hit" and Image's spy tale, "Zero". She is currently working on the upcoming "The Empty Man" with Cullen Bunn and shares stories of her artistic upbringing in Cuba, as well as her father's daring escape on a homemade boat during a hurricane! ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[Recently there was an exceptional documentary, "Jodorowsky's Dune", that examined the failed attempt of director Alejandro Jodorowsky to create a movie of Paul Herbert's legendary sci fi epic, "Dune". Wendi talks to one of the producers of the film regarding this extraordinary experience that involved such art luminaries as Moebius, HR Giger, Dan O'Bannon and Salvador Dali. Even after the project failed Jodorowsky and Moebius went on to create some of the most imaginitive works in comics- "The Incal" and "Metabarons", as well as creating tremendous impact on films such as "Star Wars".

What do you re-read? Why? Are comics more re-readable than other mediums? Are there comics that have gotten better or worse on re-reading? Do you recommend any comics that people should give a second chance? Are there comics that you wish people would just stop fucking reading. 

In TV corner we discuss HBO's True Detective 

Campbell Quiz
Endorsement  Forever Evil: Rouge Rebellion, Parker series:Slay ground, HBO's Treme, Arrow,

  <description><![CDATA[Darrell has a new microphone and can't stop bragging, but its o.k. because he's gotten 4 great guests for the show to be announced soon. (we drop hints though). J.K. recaps his dinner with Paul Chadwick and Harlan Ellison and then they both talk some comics.

	00:27:45 - CAPTAIN MARCUS BERTRAND'S LOG - Meet the "pleasure pet". Bertrand once again shows us that there are no depths to which he won't sink. Like him on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/CaptainMarcusBertrand

	00:30:54 - THIS WEEKS COMICS - Black Dynamite!  J.K. reviews issue 1 of an IDW mini series, based on the movie and animated series on Adult Swim.
Darrell reviews EGO's; a much awaited title since having creator Stuart Moore on the show. It more than lives up to our expectations.

	00:45:43 - OFF TO THE PUB - We are joined at the pub by Chris Peterson to talk about his amazing work on DarkHorse's GrindHouse.

	00:20:45 - THIS WEEK's COMICS - JK tries to discuss Dark Horse's "5th Beatle" but ultimately decides that IDW's new mini, "Mr.Peabody and Sherman" http://read.idwpublishing.com/Mr-Peabody-Sherman/comics-series/12012 will annoy Darrell even more.
Darrel introduces us to "Bunker" by Fialkov. http://www.thebunkercomic.com/

	00:25:10 - OFF TO THE PUB - Darrell and JK are joined again by "friend of the show" Peter David! We talk about his incredible 8  year run on X-Factor and what's in store for the new Marvel Now series!! http://www.denofgeek.us/books-comics/x-factor/231487/marvel-comics-preview-all-new-x-factor-1

We talk about his work with Nathan Edmondson http://www.amazon.com/The-Activity-Volume-1-TP/dp/1607065614 and then get in depth about that same creative team on the new Marvel Now's Punisher. http://www.mitchgerads.com/2013/10/all-new-marvel-punisher-announced.html

  <media:title><![CDATA[JK's Happy Hour: Star Trek: Mr. Scott2]]></media:title>
  <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[In this episode Darrell and J.K. celebrate "Star Trek: Into Darknness" with an all Star Trek episode. 
   We talk to the 2 Scotts of comic book Trek; writer Scott Tipton and IDW editor Scott Dunnbier. 
   Tipton joins us for the intro and review segments of the show. Here, we discuss the modern day legend of Captain Marcus Bertrand https://www.facebook.com/CaptainMarcusBertrand?fref=ts before a review of the movie leads to tangents from "Star Trek II: Wrath of Kahn" to TNG character development and TOS episodes like "Space Seed" and "The Cage" featuring "Serial Killer Spock"
   Then we join Dunnbier in Ten Forward for some green drinks and a discussion of IDW's current, past, and upcoming Star Trek releases.

  <title><![CDATA[Nothing's On ep 59 A podcast within a podcast]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[In this very special podcast crossover ShawnPryor of PKD The Black box   joins  Donny Salvo and Darrell Taylor as they discuss their TV review podcast "Nothings On," why reality television is destructive, reasons why viewers are walking away from network tv, how NBC lost it's identity and continues to stay losing, Darrell's hatred of the Muppets, 60's Batman, sci-fi shows and tangents aplenty. 
 
In other words, we're talking a lot about TV on this one.
 
Be sure to listen to the aftershow segment after the episode ends. Trust me.

  <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this very special podcast crossover ShawnPryor of PKD The Black box   joins  Donny Salvo and Darrell Taylor as they discuss their TV review podcast "Nothings On," why reality television is destructive, reasons why viewers are walking away from network tv, how NBC lost it's identity and continues to stay losing, Darrell's hatred of the Muppets, 60's Batman, sci-fi shows and tangents aplenty. 
 
In other words, we're talking a lot about TV on this one.
